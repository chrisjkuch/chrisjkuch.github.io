## Dean Malmgren Bio

Throughout Dean's career, he has taken pride in fearlessly asking questions, impatiently pushing himself, inspiring others, passionately learning new topics, and otherwise leading by example.

Dean joined IDEO through the acquisition of Datascope, a data science consulting firm he co-founded in 2009. At Datascope, Dean and his colleagues pioneered the practice of human-centered data science by incorporating lessons from the design, software development, and entrepreneur communities, which allowed them to deliver meaningful solutions for clients ranging from Fortune 500 clients like P&G and Oracle to local non-profits and start-ups like IssueLab.

As an Executive Portfolio Director at IDEO, Dean helps IDEO and its clients identify meaningful opportunities to use data as a design medium and push the boundaries of data science in service of humans. This involves everything from understanding the needs of people and data asset design to product differentiation and algorithm design.

Dean discovered his passion for computational modeling as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan (BS Mathematics, BSE Chemical Engineering) and was inspired by the potential of data and algorithms as a graduate student at Northwestern University (PhD Chemical & Biological Engineering) where he studied the interdisciplinary area of complex systems.

Dean's work has been featured in places like Crain's, TIME, FastCo, Wired, and US News & World Report and, whenever possible, he shares his experience and perspective through his writing and speaking. He further gives back by maintaining open source projects like textract and scrubadub and advising organizations like Elemetric, Metis, NUvention Analytics, and the School of Information at the University of Michigan.
