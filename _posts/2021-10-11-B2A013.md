## Jane Zanzig Bio

Jane is most inspired by learning new things and connecting to people. Before joining IDEO, Jane worked at UChicago on projects involving everything from predicting illegal dumping of hazardous waste, to optimizing the locations of Dutch traffic inspectors, to facilitating group activities for the Data Science for Social Good fellowship.

Linear Algebra was Jane's gateway drug to math. She then got hooked on probability and optimization and went on to pursue her MS in Statistics. As much as she loves learning about nerd stuff, she loves communicating about it even more; she keeps a “Random Forests in Five Minutes” talk in her back pocket, and traveled to México City to lead a workshop on Model Evaluation and Bias in Data Science Projects.

As a “Jack of no trades, master of fun,” Jane never stays in one place too long and maintains a steadily growing list of unfinished projects. She is a certified yoga teacher and amateur taxidermist, and her hidden talents include parallel parking and being able to fall asleep anywhere. In her free time, she enjoys riding her bike on Chicago summer nights, baking her mom's peanut butter cookies, and playing with her princely pup Echo.
